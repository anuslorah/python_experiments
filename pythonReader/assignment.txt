develop a console application in Python with the following requirements:

The application should accept two input parameters
Path to a text file used to read from or write to
Read/write switch denoting whether the user action is to read the file or to write to the file
When the user action is to "read" the file
You should read the file line by line and find the word "imperdiet" in every line
The output of the read operation is to
count how many times the word "imperdiet" exists in the file
and in how many lines it appears
When the user action is to "write" to the file
You should prompt the user to enter a sentence
You should look for the word "imperdiet" in every sentence entered by the user
The output of the "write" action should be
how many sentences the user entered
how many times the word "imperdiet" appear in the user input
in how many sentences the word "imperdiet" appeared
While implementing the code, you must also instrument your code for logging and performance as follows.

You will use Python's logging framework to store log information to the "consoleapp.log" file. You must have log messages with each of the following levels: CRITICAL, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE. You should configure your logging to log with TRACE level but allow for easy reconfiguration to other log levels without code changes.

You will also need to collect the following performance metrics for your code:

Total execution time
When in "read" mode
Average time to read a line from the file
Average time to find the word "imperdiet" in the line
When in "write" mode
Average time to write a line in the file
Average time to find the word "imperdiet" in the line
You should add an additional (administrative) input to the program to allow the user to print the performance statistics after the output.

To test the application, you need to go to https://lipsum.com (Links to an external site.) and generate 1000 paragraphs of text and test your console application. You should test with TRACE level logging and metrics output.
